You are given an array/list 'ARR' of 'N' positive integers and an integer 'K.
Your task is to check if there exists a subset in 'ARR' with a sum equal to "K"."

Note: Return true if there exists a subset with sum equal to 'K.

Otherwise, return false.

For Example:
If ARR is (1,2,3,4) and K4, then there exists 2 subsets with sum = 4.
These are (1,3) and (4). Hence, return True.
